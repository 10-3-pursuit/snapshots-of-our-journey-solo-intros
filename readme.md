## Objective:

To share brief, **30 second**, impactful introductions of each squad member, focusing on the unique life experiences and journeys into programming, especially highlighting life circumstances backgrounds that lead you to Pursuit.

## Instructions for Each Team Member

### INDEPENDANTLY

#### Prepare Your Story (Preparation Time: 30 minutes)

- Reflect on your life experiences, especially focusing on your background and experiences. Consider how these experiences contributed to your path into programming and to Pursuit.
- Identify a key experience or moment that was a turning point for you in deciding to pursue a career in tech at Pursuit.
- Craft a concise narrative that ties together your life experience with your decision to become a programmer. Your story should aim to inspire and resonate with others who may have faced similar obstacles.
  Rehearse your story to ensure it's impactful yet fits within the 30-second time frame.

#### Presentation Structure

- Opening (5-10 seconds): Start with a strong, engaging sentence that introduces the core of your story, such as, "Facing eviction, I found solace and hope in the lines of code I began to learn late at night..."
- Middle (15-20 seconds): Share the essence of your journey, focusing on a pivotal challenge, how you overcame it, and the role programming played in this process. Highlight any significant life experience that led to a sense of achievement or realization.
- Conclusion (5 seconds): End with your name and your current role, tying it back to your journey, "And that's how I, Maria Chen, turned my trials into a triumph as a software developer."

### Squad Presentation Instructions (30 minutes)

**As A Squad You Should:**

- Discuss and decide on the order of presentations.
- Do a practice run based on this order. (each fellow should know who precedes them and be ready to start when that fellow finishes)
- Consider changing the order based on similarity in story. (your choice whether to put similarities together or split apart. Both can be impactful)
